# 💫 Weather Forecasting 

Weather forecasting is an application of Time Series Forecasting where we use time-series data and algorithms to make forecasts for a given time period. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset for weather forecasting.

## 📊 Dataset 

The dataset used for weather forecasting is located in the `data/` directory. It consists of the following files:

### ✨ DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv 

This file contains historical weather data for Delhi, India, used for training the forecasting model. It includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation levels.

### ✨ DailyDelhiClimateTest.csv 

This file contains weather data for Delhi, India, used for testing and evaluating the trained forecasting model.

## 📓 Notebook 

The `weather_forecasting.ipynb` notebook contains the code and explanations for the weather forecasting process. It includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data, identifying patterns, and understanding the relationships between different features.
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing an appropriate time series forecasting model, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet.
4. **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the historical data (DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv).
5. **Forecasting**: Using the trained model to make forecasts for future time periods.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the forecasting model using appropriate metrics and the test data (DailyDelhiClimateTest.csv).

## 🧊 Usage 

To run the notebook and replicate the weather forecasting process, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels, or fbprophet).
3. Open the `weather_forecasting.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform EDA, train the model, and generate forecasts.
